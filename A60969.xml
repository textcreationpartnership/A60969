            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To my FRIEND Tho. Skipwith, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
            </head>
            <p>THere is that certain Argument of Poverty in Poetry, that its Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring muſt always be laid at ſomebodies Door; and indeed, the greatest Maſter of this Art, will ſcarce be able to ſupport the Iſſue of his Brain, upon the narrow Income of a ſingle Reputation.</p>
            <p>From the very Start of my Deſign upon this Play, I had a Deſign up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, like a rich Godfather, to eaſe the Pariſh of a Charge, and the Parent of a Care, in maintaining it.</p>
            <p>You know the Original of Sir <hi>Antony,</hi> and therefore can beſt judge how the Copy is drawn; tho' it won't be to my Advantage to have 'em too narrowly compar'd; her Wit is indeed inimitable, not to be painted: Yet I must ſay, there's ſomething in my Draught of her, that carries a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance, and makes up a very tolerable Figure: And ſince I have this occaſion of mentioning Mrs. <hi>Montford,</hi> I am pleaſed, by way of Thanks, to do her that publick Juſtice in Print, which ſome of the beſt Judges of theſe Performances, have, in her Praiſe, already done her, in publick places; That they never ſaw any part more maſterly play'd: And as I made every Line for her, ſhe has mended every Word for me; and by a Gaiety and Air, particular to her Action, turn'd every thing into the Genius of the Character.</p>
            <p>You have here Seven hundred Lines more in the Print, than was upon the Stage, which I cut out in the apprehenſion and dread of a long Play.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Abbe</hi>'s Character languiſhes in the Fifth Act for want of the Scene between him and Sir <hi>Antony,</hi> which I plainly ſaw before, but was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to leave a Gap in the Action, and to loſe the advantage of Mr. <hi>Lee</hi>'s Playing (which, tho' his Part, that place only gvve him an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſhew) then run the venture of offending the Women; not that there is one indecent Expreſſion in it; but the over-fine Folk might run it into a deſign I never had in my head: my meaning was, to expoſe the Vice; and I thought it cou'd not be more contemptibly expos'd, than in the Perſon of a wanton Old Man, that muſt make ev'n the moſt faſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Pleaſure ridiculous.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:93295:3"/>
            <p>I am gratefully ſenſible of the general good Nature of the Town to me, which you muſt give me leave to value my ſelf upon, ſince the Pride pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from an Opinion, that I have deſerv'd no otherwiſe from any Man. But I muſt make my boaſt (tho' with the moſt acknowledging reſpect) of the Favours for the Fair Sex (I may call 'em Favours, and I may boaſt of Ladies Favours, when there are ſo many concern'd) in ſo viſibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting my Intereſt, on thoſe Days chiefly (the Third, and the Sixth) when I had the tendereſt relation to the welfare of my Play. I won't from their Encouragement imagine I am the better Poet, but I will for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, endeavour not to give 'em cauſe of repenting ſo ſeaſonable a piece of good Nature; and if I can't give 'em a good Comedy, I won't give 'em a very bad one: This has had its Fate, and a very favourable one. And I cannot but have the better eſteem of it, for bringing ſo many of my Well-wiſhers together.</p>
            <p>So far for Prefacing.</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, as to my Dedication: I fear my Credit in this place, is as little worth, as in <hi>Lumbard-ſtreet;</hi> you may take up Money upon it, as ſoon as a Reputation: But the Bleſſing of the Fortune lies in having as little need of your Friend's Purſe in the City, as your Friend's Praiſe in <hi>Coven-Garden:</hi> They who know you, will take you upon your own Word; and they who don't, will hardly upon mine. However, this I muſt ſay, if there be a quickneſs in the Dialogue, and Converſation of this Comedy, I owe it in a great meaſure to my familiarity with you; which in the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of ſeveral Years, has giv'n me a thouſand occaſions of Envy and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration; and at laſt perſwaded me to an Imitation of what I have heard with ſo much pleaſure and pain.

                     <p>Very Caſuiſtically brought about, Sir. And I am ſo much of your Opinion, that I think the Lady cannot do her ſelf a better juſtice, nor me a greater favour, than allow me to wait upon her on ſuch an occaſion.</p>

                     <p>Why, what the Devil am I engaging in agen! I ſhall draw all the Women in Town upon me, at this rate: Maids, Wives, and Widows, have one Curioſity or another always to be ſatisfi'd. I have a Reputation among 'em; and if I don't keep it up, by anſwering their Expectations—I ſhall fail of mine, in my Frollicks, and be diſcover'd; and that I have no mind to be yet a while! But how the Devil ſhall I anſwer their Expectations—Or this Lady's in particular, who has beſpoke me for her Evening Service? If I go, I ſhall diſappoint her more than if I ſtay away; and I know, good Soul, ſhe wou'd be as much concern'd for me, to find me no Man, as at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time ſhe wou'd be for her ſelf, to be found no Maid, if ſhe had a mind to be thought one.

                     <speaker>Sir Ant.</speaker>
                     <p>And condemns the Men too: For 'tis not any Man's Opinion, but his ſhifting it to the Occaſion, that makes him a Raſcal; as let his Opinion be what it will, if he continues the ſame, and acts upon a Principle, he may be an honeſt Man: But 'tis no Character I wou'd adviſe a Friend to.</p>

            <head>PROLOGUE. Spoken by Mrs. <hi>Bracegirdle.</hi>
            </head>
            <l>THE Ladies have a lonely Summer paſt,</l>
            <l>In hopes kind Winter would return at laſt.</l>
            <l>The Seaſons change; but Heroes at the ſame,</l>
            <l>A Twelve-month running in purſuit of Fame.</l>
            <l>Theirs may be good, but they have ſpoilt our Game.</l>
            <l>Some weak amends this thin Town might afford,</l>
            <l>If honeſt Gentlemen would keep their word.</l>
            <l>But your lewd <hi>Tunbridge</hi>-Scandal that was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</l>
            <l>Foretold how ſad a Time wou'd come for Loving.</l>
            <l>Sad Time indeed when you begin to write:</l>
            <l>'Tis a ſhrewd ſign of wanting Appetite,</l>
            <l>When you forget your ſelves, to think of Wit.</l>
            <l>Whilſt thus your Itch is only to beſpatter,</l>
            <l>Your Cupid is transform'd into a Satyr:</l>
            <l>Nothing of Man about you, all o're Beaſt;</l>
            <l>Submitting your chief pleaſure to your Jeſt.</l>
            <l>Then Time will come (for <hi>Ireland</hi> falls of Courſe,</l>
            <l>And muſt ſend back her Conquerours, and ours)</l>
            <l>When each of us our Loſſes do recover,</l>
            <l>Will mend her Fortune in a Soldier-Lover:</l>
            <l>They'l uſe us better much, then you have done,</l>
            <l>Take us in, paſſing, like an open Town,</l>
            <l>And plunder, do their buſineſs, and be gone.</l>
            <l>Or if, at leiſure, they lye down to wooe,</l>
            <l>They'l rather make us Whores, then call us ſo:</l>
            <l>Not ſend a whiſp'ring Libel thro' the Town,</l>
            <l>To blab the Favour out, before 'tis done;</l>
            <l>And maul the Ladies only in Lampoon.</l>
            <l>But if they write in a Sententious Strain,</l>
            <l>Two Lines conclude the Travels of their Pen;</l>
            <l>One, only to know where, and t'other, when.</l>
            <l>And we can give a Lover leave to write,</l>
            <l>When all his Bills are to be paid at ſight.</l>
            <l>O! wou'd our peaceful days were come agen;</l>
            <l>Then I might act it, on and off, a Queen.</l>
            <l>When once the Child was turn'd into her Teens,</l>
            <l>You cou'd not find a Maid behind the Scenes.</l>
            <l>But now your keeping humor's out a door,</l>
            <l>We muſt dye Maids, or marry to be poor.</l>

            <head>EPILOGUE. Spoken by Mrs. <hi>Botelar.</hi>
            </head>
            <l>IF Novelty has any Charms to move,</l>
            <l>We hope, to Night, we've rais'd your drooping Love:</l>
            <l>Not to the Youngſters of a noiſy Pit,</l>
            <l>Whoſe Tongues and Miſtreſſes out-run their Wit:</l>
            <l>But to the graver Sinners of the Bench.</l>
            <l>Who, from your Mothers Maids, have lov'd a Wench:</l>
            <l>Who, cheek by joul with Time, have handled down</l>
            <l>The Vices of all Ages to your own:</l>
            <l>Here's a Variety, that may delight</l>
            <l>The Palate of each Ages Appetite.</l>
            <l>To you I'm ſent, you who have dearly known</l>
            <l>The ſeveral Rates of Pleaſure in this Town;</l>
            <l>And find at laſt, 'tis worth but your Half-Crown.</l>
            <l>You'l hear with Patience a dull Scene, to ſee,</l>
            <l>In a contented lazy waggery,</l>
            <l>The Female <hi>Montford</hi> bare above the knee.</l>
            <l>She makes a mighty noiſe, like ſome of you,</l>
            <l>Who often talk of what you never do:</l>
            <l>She's for all Womankind, and aws the Town,</l>
            <l>As if her Husband's Breeches were her own.</l>
            <l>She's been to Night our Hero, tho' a Female,</l>
            <l>Show me but ſuch a Whoremaſter, tho' a Male</l>
            <l>Who thro' ſo many ſhifts, is ſtill the ſame,</l>
            <l>Purſues all Petticoats, preſerves her Fame,</l>
            <l>And tho' ſhe can do nothing, keeps the Name.</l>
            <l>Some of your Names are up too we ſuppoſe,</l>
            <l>Who turn'd of fifty, ſtill wou'd paſs for Beau's:</l>
            <l>You dance, you dreſs, you ſing, you keep a noiſe,</l>
            <l>And think you're young, becauſe you herd with Boys.</l>
            <l>To ſuch as you, there is no Mercy owing;</l>
            <l>Your talking muſt not ſerve for your not doing.</l>
            <l>And ſince your feeble failings within doors</l>
            <l>Are known to us, be wiſe, and even Scores;</l>
            <l>Supply our Wants, and we'll conceal all yours.</l>
            <l>No matter what you can, or cannot do,</l>
            <l>You ſhall cheat others ſtill, if we cheat you:</l>
            <l>Keep us but rich, and fine, and we ſhall find</l>
            <l>Young Lovers, always able to be kind.</l>
